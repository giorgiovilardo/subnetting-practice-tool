# Subnetting Practice Tool

The 2022 edition of the old tool to practice subnetting, written many moons ago,
when I was teaching network engineering basics at the Cisco CCNA courses.

Now with a website and an API too!

## What it does

Right now not much, but it just needs to generate a random IP with a subnet mask in CIDR notation.
Then the student will answer.

## Why

I have a little bit of free time while changing jobs, so why not.
I need to get back to writing little side projects, starting small and in C# is awesome.
Maybe I will rewrite it in F# or Elixir or whatnot. I like the problem, I know the domain,
I can compare solutions.

## Project roadmap
